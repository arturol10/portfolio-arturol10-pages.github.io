		<h1>Learning to Code</h1>
		<h2>How I got to where I am</h2>

		<p>I always thought of doing something that involves compueters, but I was never motivated. Even now I need motivation. There's nobody in my circle of friends or the people I know that are into computers.</p>

		<p>I started looking and I can't really remember how I got to an specific podcast that he made it sound like it was really easy.</p>

		<p>His name is <a href="https://castig.org/" target="_blank">Christopher Castiglione</a>. He really makes the lessons more brighter and easier for you to understand.</p>

		<p>I was able to create this website thanks to his teachings, and believe it when he says to not be afraid to google questions you may have on your own.</p>
